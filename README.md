## Centered Button Demo ##

A client is looking for a custom row of circular buttons. The right-most button has text embedded below it, within the graphic image. The left-most button is similar, but has some text embedded below it.

The client wants the row of buttons to show up in a row in the Android app, all lined up nicely, so that the centers of each button image are aligned. The text of the left and right buttons will be offset above or below the row of buttons.

The best way to do this is by creating the button images so that they all have the same height. This project demonstrates how that's done and what the finished product looks like.
